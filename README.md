## Usage

Mod builds can be found [here](https://github.com/eclipseisoffline/customname/packages/2065010).

This mod is oriented at Fabric Minecraft servers, but works on the client as well.
This mod requires the Fabric API, and is currently only available for Minecraft 1.20.4,
but you can make a version port request at the issue tracker.

The `/name` command can be used as follows:

- `/name prefix` - sets a prefix for your name, or when no prefix is given, clears your prefix.
  - Requires operator or the `customname.prefix` permission.
- `/name suffix` - sets a suffix for your name, or when no suffix is given, clears your suffix.
  - Requires operator or the `customname.suffix` permission.
- `/name nickname` - sets a nickname that will appear instead of your IGN. When hovered above this nickname, your IGN will show. When no nickname is given, clears your nickname.
  - Requires operator or the `customname.nick` permission.

Minecraft's [formatting codes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Formatting_codes) can be used to format your prefix, suffix or nickname.
Instead of the `ยง` character, use `&`. A useful tool to easily create formatted names is available [here](https://codepen.io/0biwan/pen/ggVemP).
Usage of formatting codes in names can be disabled in the config file.

## Config file

The mod's configuration file is present in `{root config directory}/eclipsescustomname.json`.
By default, the configuration file looks like this:

```json
{
  "enable_formatting": true,
  "require_permissions": true,
  "blacklisted_names": []
}
```

- `enable_formatting` can be used to disable the use of Minecraft formatting codes in names.
- `require_permissions` can be used to disable the permission requirement. When set to `false`, the `/name` command is available to everyone.
- `blacklisted_names` is a list of regexes that are blacklisted. When a prefix, suffix or nickname matches one of these regexes, they won't be able to be used.

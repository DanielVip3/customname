## Usage

The `/name` command can be used as follows:

- `/name prefix` - sets a prefix for your name, or when no prefix is given, clears your prefix.
  - Requires operator or the `customname.prefix` permission.
- `/name suffix` - sets a suffix for your name, or when no suffix is given, clears your suffix.
  - Requires operator or the `customname.suffix` permission.
- `/name nickname` - sets a nickname that will appear instead of your IGN. When hovered above this nickname, your IGN will show. When no nickname is given, clears your nickname.
  - Requires operator or the `customname.nick` permission.
